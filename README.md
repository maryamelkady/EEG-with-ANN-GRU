# Emotion Classification from EEG Signals

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying human emotions using EEG (Electroencephalography) signals. The study involves preprocessing EEG data, building deep learning models, and evaluating their performance for effective emotion classification.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Standardized EEG signal data.
- Visualized EEG patterns for better understanding.
- Split data into training and testing sets.

### Model Development
- Built and trained **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** models.
- Leveraged **GRUâ€™s ability to capture temporal dependencies** in EEG signals.

### Model Evaluation
- Assessed performance using a **confusion matrix** and **prediction analysis**.
- Demonstrated effective classification of emotions from EEG signals.

## Future Work
- Enhance feature extraction techniques to improve model performance.
- Integrate real-time EEG signal processing for live emotion classification.
- Explore hybrid deep learning models for better accuracy.
